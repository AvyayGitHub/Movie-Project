# **Welcome to the Movie Project!!!**

The purpose of this project is to give you an overview and description of every movie that exists: past, present, or future.
This is also one of the largest databases of movies, so I'm sure that you will find your movie and its description.

If you use a regular HTML editor, this **won't work properly**.
The code here is using React JS, so I would reccomend using an open-source editor, such as CodeSandbox.
## CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io
